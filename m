Hi Suzuki,

I sent the message below off-list a few weeks ago, but I'm following up
on-list in case it didn't reach you.

Since then, I've started reworking the series based on the
kvm_device_attr approach you suggested, and I'm currently testing it
against v23 of the CCA host support.

I'd still appreciate any feedback on the ABI direction, as well as
whether you see any concerns with posting the RFC series while the host
support is not yet upstream.

Thanks,
Kohei
