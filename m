KVM: guest_memfd: Introduce guest memory ops and route native gmem through =
them

This commit introduces a kvm_gmem_ops vtable to allow other subsystems to
supply guest memory backing. It routes the built-in guest_memfd operations
through this vtable and refactors the generic bind, unbind, and populate
flows.

[Severity: High]
Is there a missing module reference count in struct kvm_gmem_ops?=20

The operations table lacks an owner field (like struct module *owner) to pin
the backend module.

Since the shared kvm_gmem_fops routes file operations to a foreign backend's
vtable, could a user open the guest_memfd, unload the backend module, and
then close the file? The release dispatcher would then call into the unload=
ed
module's release hook, potentially causing a kernel panic.

[Severity: High]
Does this function miss initializing slot->gmem.file on a successful bind?

KVM core code relies heavily on slot->gmem.file being populated to later ca=
ll
unbind. If a foreign backend succeeds in ops->bind but doesn't intentionally
mutate KVM's internal slot->gmem.file state, KVM might never call unbind
when the memslot is subsequently freed.

Could this leak backend resources or leave dangling memslot pointers in the
backend?

[Severity: High]
Is it safe to dereference the file locklessly here?

The generic code previously used get_file_active() to safely obtain a
reference. Because kvm_gmem_bind() intentionally drops its reference to the
file on success (via fput(file)), userspace can close the guest_memfd
concurrently while the memslot is being destroyed.

Could this result in a use-after-free when kvm_gmem_get_ops() attempts to
dereference the unrefcounted file pointer?

[Severity: Critical]
Does dropping the page reference before calling post_populate() introduce a
time-of-check to time-of-use race?

If the backend provides a physical page via get_pfn() and we drop the pin
with put_page(ignored_page) early, the page could be concurrently freed and
reallocated to another process.

Could this cause the hardware post_populate callback (such as SNP RMPUPDATE)
to operate on a physical page that now belongs to an innocent host process,
corrupting host memory?
