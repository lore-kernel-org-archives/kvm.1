commit 7bfeb9f519ccce1291a261c36607819a68c027ce
Author: David Woodhouse <dwmw@amazon.co.uk>
Subject: samples/kvm: Add guest_memfd backing sample

This commit adds a sample guest_memfd provider module for KVM. It
demonstrates page-less backing from a fixed physical range or a
CMA-allocated contiguous region. It also includes page revocation
via a bitmap and a dma-buf exporter.

[Severity: High]
Does gmem_max_order() account for pages marked absent?

When KVM queries the maximum mapping order for a present faulting page,
gmem_max_order() checks alignment and remaining length, but does not check
if any of the subsequent pages within the hugepage range are marked absent
in info->absent.

If a subset of pages in a 2M or 1G range is revoked but the faulting page
is present, could KVM install a hugepage mapping that grants the guest
unauthorized access to the revoked pages within that block?

[Severity: High]
Does gmem_bind() only track a single memslot binding?

KVM allows a single provider fd to back multiple memslots. However,
gmem_bind() overwrites info->base_gfn and info->pgoff with the new
slot's coordinates.

During GMEM_PROVIDER_SET_PRESENT, KVM is only asked to invalidate the singl=
e,
most recently bound GFN range. Older slots would be ignored and their guest
NPT/EPT mappings never zapped. Can this result in a complete bypass of the
page revocation mechanism for previously bound slots?

[Severity: High]
Will the psmash() operation be skipped if the start address is unaligned?

The loop advances i by PTRS_PER_PMD (which is 512) and checks if the combin=
ed
pfn is perfectly aligned to a 2M boundary.

If info->base_pfn + start is not 2M-aligned to begin with, adding 512
guarantees that every subsequent PFN checked will also be unaligned.
psmash() would never be called for any 2M boundaries inside the range.
Could this cause subsequent rmp_make_shared() calls to fail?

[Severity: High]
Does this code handle concurrent bindings safely?

In gmem_bind(), info->kvm is read and modified without any locking. If a
single provider file is concurrently bound to multiple VMs (or the same VM
multiple times), multiple threads could race, reading the same old info->kvm
pointer and both calling kvm_put_kvm().

This could lead to a double-put and Use-After-Free of the KVM instances.
Additionally, gmem_fd_ioctl() accesses info->kvm without locks while it
might be concurrently updated or freed. Could we add synchronization to
protect info->kvm?

[Severity: High]
Is a call to psmash() required before rmp_make_shared() here?

On SEV-SNP hosts, converting a 2M private page back to the shared state
using rmp_make_shared() with PG_LEVEL_4K fails unless the 2M RMP entry is
first shattered using psmash().

gmem_unbind() omits the psmash() step and ignores the return value of
rmp_make_shared(). This could leave 2M pages permanently marked as private.
When these CMA pages are freed and reused by the host allocator, wouldn't
accessing them crash the host?

[Severity: Critical]
Does gmem_release() free memory while it is still mapped into the guest?

When the provider fd is closed, gmem_release() frees info->cma_pages and
the info struct. However, it does not appear to zap the guest's NPT/EPT
page tables or clear the KVM slot tracking pointer.

This leaves the guest with full read/write access to the freed CMA pages
after they have been reallocated to other kernel subsystems. When KVM later
destroys the memslot, it could also dereference the dangling slot->gmem.file
pointer. Should the mappings be explicitly torn down before freeing?

[Severity: High]
Should gmem_mmap() validate the mmap_capable policy?

gmem_bind() refuses to bind to encrypted VMs if info->mmap_capable is set,
in order to protect the host. However, gmem_mmap() maps the memory to
userspace without verifying info->mmap_capable.

Userspace could clear GMEM_PROVIDER_FLAG_MMAP_CAPABLE during setup,
successfully bind to a SEV-SNP/TDX VM, and then call mmap() on the fd
anyway. Could this allow host access to hardware-encrypted memory and
cause a machine check exception or RMP violation?

[Severity: Medium]
Should the revocation wait for the completion of mapping teardowns?

In gmem_dma_buf_revoke_all(), dma_buf_invalidate_mappings() is called, but
it doesn't wait on priv->comp. This leaves the completion machinery unused
and leaks the kref initialized in gmem_provider_get_dmabuf().

Should we properly wait for the mappings to be torn down and drop the
reference?

[Severity: Medium]
Will this error path leak the provider file reference?

Earlier in gmem_provider_get_dmabuf(), get_file(file) is called to increment
the reference count. If dma_buf_export() fails, the function frees priv and
returns an error, but it doesn't appear to call fput(priv->provider_file).

Could userspace trigger this intentionally (e.g., by hitting file descriptor
limits) to permanently leak the file and its associated CMA memory?

[Severity: High]
Are these bitmap operations safe against concurrent updates?

In gmem_fd_ioctl(), GMEM_PROVIDER_SET_PRESENT uses bitmap_set() and
bitmap_clear() without synchronization. These functions perform non-atomic
read-modify-write operations on the underlying unsigned long elements.

If userspace concurrently revokes or restores different page ranges that fa=
ll
within the same bitmap word, won't the updates race and clobber each other,
potentially allowing the guest unauthorized access?

[Severity: High]
Can this arithmetic underflow if start_index < info->pgoff?

If userspace specifies a revocation range that starts before the offset whe=
re
the slot was bound (start_index < info->pgoff), the subtraction here will
underflow to a massive unsigned value.

kvm_gmem_invalidate_range() would then use this bogus GFN range, fail to
find the correct slot, and skip the invalidation entirely, leaving revoked
pages mapped in the guest. Should we bounds-check start_index against
info->pgoff?

[Severity: Critical]
Is it possible for userspace to provide a file descriptor that is not a KVM
VM file?

Looking at gmem_ctl_ioctl(), the code calls fget() on setup.kvm_fd and blin=
dly
dereferences kvm_file->private_data. If an unprivileged user passes an
arbitrary file descriptor (like an eventfd or socket), this would cast
its private_data to a struct kvm *.

This could lead to arbitrary kernel memory corruption when kvm_get_kvm()
subsequently performs an atomic increment at the offset of users_count on
that arbitrary data structure. Should we verify the file's operations
(e.g., checking kvm_file->f_op) before casting?

[ ... ]
> +	info->absent =3D bitmap_zalloc(info->npages, GFP_KERNEL);

[Severity: High]
Can info->npages be truncated during bitmap allocation?

info->npages is a 64-bit unsigned long. If the module is loaded with a large
external addr=3D/len=3D range (e.g., 16TB), info->npages exceeds 32 bits.
bitmap_zalloc() takes an unsigned int for nbits, which would silently
truncate this value, allocating a smaller bitmap.

An unprivileged user could then call GMEM_PROVIDER_SET_PRESENT with a large
offset that passes the 64-bit bounds check, causing bitmap_set() to write
far beyond the truncated allocation. Does this allow a kernel heap buffer
overflow?

[ ... ]
> +	fd =3D anon_inode_getfd("[gmem-provider]", &kvm_gmem_fops,
> +			      &info->backing, O_RDWR | O_CLOEXEC);

[Severity: High]
Is the provider module pinned when the file descriptor is created?

anon_inode_getfd() creates the fd using &kvm_gmem_fops, which belongs to
the KVM module. The provider module does not take a reference to itself.

If userspace closes the control fd (/dev/gmem_provider) but keeps the
provider fd open, could the gmem_provider module be unloaded via rmmod?
Subsequent VM page faults or ioctls would then call into the unloaded
module's gmem_ops, potentially causing a kernel panic.
