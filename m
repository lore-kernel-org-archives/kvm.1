It would be useful to have the RFC on the list to get an idea on shaping
the UABI. It may also be useful for people to verify the end-to-end
stack, including the remote attestation flow. (the branch we have is
ancient)

But nothing else, i.e, code correctness or functional reviews
etc (that rules out meaningful Sashiko reviews etc).
